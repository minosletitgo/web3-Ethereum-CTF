### Puzzle Wallet
* Difficulty：★★★★☆
* Nowadays, paying for DeFi operations is impossible, fact.
* A group of friends discovered how to slightly decrease the cost of performing multiple transactions by batching them in one transaction, so they developed a smart contract for doing this.
* They needed this contract to be upgradeable in case the code contained a bug, and they also wanted to prevent people from outside the group from using it. To do so, they voted and assigned two people with special roles in the system: The admin, which has the power of updating the logic of the smart contract. The owner, which controls the whitelist of addresses allowed to use the contract. The contracts were deployed, and the group was whitelisted. Everyone cheered for their accomplishments against evil miners.
* Little did they know, their lunch money was at risk…
* You'll need to hijack this wallet to become the admin of the proxy.

### 谜题钱包
* 难度：★★★★☆
* 如今，为DeFi操作支付手续费简直难如登天——这是不争的事实。
* 一群开发者发现了一种略微降低多笔交易成本的方法：将它们批量打包在一笔交易中执行。于是他们开发了一个智能合约来实现这一功能。
* 他们需要这个合约具备可升级性（以防代码中存在漏洞），同时希望阻止外部人员使用该合约。为此，他们通过投票指定了两个拥有特殊权限的角色：
    - 管理员（admin）：拥有更新智能合约逻辑的权限；
    - 所有者（owner）：控制允许使用合约的地址白名单。
* 合约已部署完成，该团队成员的地址均已加入白名单。所有人都为他们成功对抗“黑心矿工”的成就而欢呼雀跃。
* 但他们万万没有想到，自己的“午餐钱”正面临着前所未有的威胁……
* 你的任务：劫持这个钱包，成为代理合约的管理员。
