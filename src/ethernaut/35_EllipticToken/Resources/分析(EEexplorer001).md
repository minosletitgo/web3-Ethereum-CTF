# Ethernaut Level 35 EllipticToken

---

> “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” — Romans 12:21

In this game, we have to steal all the tokens that Alice (`0xA11CE84AcB91Ac59B0A4E2945C9157eF3Ab17D4e`) just redeemed.

### Contract Analysis

Each voucher, which contains the receiver's information, is hashed and that message hash is signed off-chain by both the token owner (Bob) and the receiver (Alice). After on-chain validation with `ECDSA.recover`, if both validations pass, the receiver will get the signed amount of tokens.

Then in `permit` function, `tokenOwner` and `spender` will also be verified by their signatures for token allowances.

Since Alice has a balance of the Elliptic token (ETK) greater than 0, `redeemVoucher()` must have been called at least once (with Alice being the receiver), and there *must be* some traces about it. However, because the contract has a mapping `usedHashes`, we cannot use the signature (or *impersonator*) to infiltrate with that *exact same* message hash.

This contract seems impeccable. So how can we make the attack possible? If we take a deeper look at the `permit` function, we will find something really strange:

In code line `address tokenOwner = ECDSA.recover(bytes32(amount), tokenOwnerSignature);`, the recover function does not take in the **hashed** message! Instead, it takes in a `bytes32(amount)` as a "message hash" directly without any actual encryption processes. It is not a conventional move.

So how can we take advantage of this vulnerability? Let's first leave this question here to see what we can do for the first step.

### voucherHash & Alice's signature

`redeemVoucher()` must have been called once. We can use this transaction hash to look up for more information such as the **input information** in Sepolia Etherscan, potentially getting the trace of the public `voucherHash` and Alice's signature for this message hash.

If we go to the instance's address page, then go to the internal transactions tab, we will see something like this:

![](image_Explorer.png)

The last two transactions, which are from the level's address to the address(1), are the transactions that we want to notice, since when we are calling an `ECDSA.recover()`, we will make a static call to the *precompile* , which is located exactly at address(1). For more information of the *precompile*, you can check [this link](https://lucasmartincalderon.medium.com/exploring-precompiled-contracts-on-ethereum-a-deep-dive-4e9f9682e0aa). Also, [ethernaut level 32 Impersonator](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) has a low-level implementation of `ecrecover`.

So, the *last* transaction represents `require(ECDSA.recover(voucherHash, receiverSignature) == receiver, InvalidReceiver());` code line, where `ECDSA.recover` is called after being called once before for the verification of the owner (Bob). If we check the calldata, we should see that `(voucherHash, receiverSignature)` encoded.

Input:

```
0x87f1c8cd4c0e19511304b612a9b4996f8c2bd795796636bd25812cd5b0b6a973000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001cab1dcd2a2a1c697715a62eb6522b7999d04aa952ffa2619988737ee675d9494f2b50ecce40040bcb29b5a8ca1da875968085f22b7c0a50f29a4851396251de12
```

So the `voucherHash` is `0x87f1c8cd4c0e19511304b612a9b4996f8c2bd795796636bd25812cd5b0b6a973` and Alice's signature is `0xab1dcd2a2a1c697715a62eb6522b7999d04aa952ffa2619988737ee675d9494f2b50ecce40040bcb29b5a8ca1da875968085f22b7c0a50f29a4851396251de121c`. Note that I put v (0x1c) to the end so that recovery function can take in correct input order (r, s, v).

There is also another way to find these two inputs (a little bit cheating way). Go to the source code of Ethernaut, then go to the level factory file ([EllipticTokenFactory.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut/blob/master/contracts/src/levels/EllipticTokenFactory.sol)), we can directly see these two `bytes` variables in the `createInstance` function.

### Alice's Public Key

Now that we have the (message hash, signature) pair, we can recover Alice's public key. See this formula:
$$
P = r^{-1} (sR - zG)
$$

- `r`: derived from the x-coordinate of the curve point used to generate signature.
- `s`: calculated based on secret value used in the signature generation process and the message hash.
- `R`: point that can be found on curve using x-coordinate `r` value.
- `z`: message hash.
- `G`: the generation point.

You can also check whether the calculated public key is correct by `Keccak-256` it and see whether the last 20 bytes of the result is Alice's address. Use this [Keccak256 calculator](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html).

### Signature Validation

In order to move on to the next part, there're some background knowledge for *signature validation* process in Elliptic Cryptography. Assume that we already have the public key `P` , signature (r, s) and message hash `z`. How can we validate the signature?

- Calculate $u_1 = s^{-1}z\mod n$, and $u_2 = s^{-1} r \mod n$.
- Calculate $Q = u_1G + u_2P$, and if $r == x(Q)\mod n$, signature is valid.

This validation method is based on how signature (r, s) is calculated given `P`, private key `e`, secret value `k`, and message hash `z`. For more information about ECDSA, refer to [this source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm).

### Signature Spoofing

Now we can answer the question left: how can we take advantage of *this* vulnerability (unhashed message hash)? Well, the answer is **signature spoofing**.

In signature spoofing, we use a public key and a public (signature/message hash) pair to *forge* a (signature/message hash) pair that was **not** created by the original signer. We can simply make `u1` and `u2` random to generate as many pairs as possible. Now that we have the forged message hash, since that `bytes32(amount)` is not hashed at all, it is extremely susceptible to **brute force** attack with *many* forged pairs. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Public key recovery using the known signature and message hash ($P = r^{-1}(sR-zG)$).
2. Randomly choose `0 <= u1 < n` and `0 < u2 < n`. (`u2 != 0` since we need to calculate its inverse).
3. $Q = u_1G + u_2P$, $r' = x(Q)\mod n$, ($r' \neq 0$).
4. Calculate $u_2^{-1} \mod n = u_2Inv$, $s = r * u_2Inv \mod n$. ($s' \neq 0$).
5. Decide $v$ with $y(Q)$, $r'$, $s'$.
6. $z = (u_1 * s \mod n)$.
7. Compare `z` directly with Alice's balance (10 ether). If it is larger than that, it means we can pretend that Alice had permitted us this amount. If it is smaller than 10 ether, choose a different (`u1`, `u2`) pair and go from step 3 again.
