### The Golden Ticket
- The organizers of Ekoparty decided that the tickets for the 2023 conference would be purchased through a smart contract.
- However, the conference is oversold and you have to sign up for a waitlist to get your ticket.
- The problem is that they put you on hold for ten years and the only option you have is to extend the wait.
- After the wait is over, you have to enter a raffle to see if you get the ticket

### 黄金门票
- Ekoparty 的组织者决定，2023 年会议的门票将通过智能合约购买。
- 然而，会议门票已售罄，你必须加入候补名单才能获得门票。
- 问题是他们让你等待十年，而你唯一的选择就是延长等待时间。
- 等待结束后，你还需要参加抽奖才能确定是否能获得门票。
